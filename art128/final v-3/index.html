                                <p class="dropcap">Foster Botanical Garden, measuring 13.5 acres, is one of
                                    five public botanical gardens on Oahu. It is located at 50 North Vineyard Boulevard,
                                    Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, near Chinatown at the intersection of Nu'uanu
                                    Avenue and Vineyard Boulevard. Foster is in a highly urban area with strip malls,
                                    schools, and Buddhist, Shinto, and Methodist religious facilities nearby.</p>

                                <p>The Garden is the oldest botanical garden in Hawaii, and listed on the National
                                    Register of Historic Places.</p>


                                <h3>Origins</h3>
                                <p>In 1853, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalama">Queen Kalama</a> leased 4.6
                                    acres of land to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hillebrand">William
                                        Hillebrand</a>,
                                    a German physician and botanist who built his home and planted trees on the site.
                                    During his stay, he introduced a number of plants to Hawaii, as well as deer and
                                    mynah birds. Many of the large trees growing today on the Upper Terrace were
                                    Hillebrand's plantings. After 20 years Hillebrand returned to Germany, where he
                                    published Flora of the Hawaiian Islands in 1888. In 1884 the property was sold to
                                    Thomas R. Foster and his wife Mary E. Foster (née Robinson), who continued to
                                    develop the garden as their homesite. Upon her death in 1930, Mary Foster bequeathed
                                    the land and her home to the City and County of Honolulu, with the provision that
                                    the city accept and forever keep and properly maintain the (gardens) as a public and
                                    tropical park to be known and called Foster Park. At the time, the gardens were
                                    roughly 5.5 acres.</p>

                                <p> Harold Lyon, the first director of Foster Garden, introduced thousands of new plants
                                    and trees to Hawaii, and started its famous orchid collection. Paul Weissich,
                                    director from 1957 to 1989, expanded Foster Garden to 14 acres of native
                                    plants, and developed four additional sites on Oahu Island to create the 650 acres
                                    Honolulu Botanical Gardens system. Taken as a whole, these five gardens
                                    feature rare species from tropical environments ranging from desert to rainforest,
                                    comprising the largest and most diverse tropical plant collection in the United
                                    States.</p>

                                <p> The Garden is the inspiration for a line in Joni Mitchell's 1970 folk song <a
                                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Yellow_Taxi">"Big Yellow Taxi"</a>:
                                    "Took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum / Then charge people a dollar and a
                                    half just to see 'em.".</p>

                                <h3>Foster Botanical Garden Today</h3>

                                <p>Today the garden consists of the Upper Terrace (the oldest part of the garden);
                                    Middle Terraces (palms, aroids, heliconias, gingers); Economic Garden (herbs,
                                    spices, dyes, poisons); Prehistoric Glen (primitive plants planted in 1965); Lyon
                                    Orchid Garden; and Hybrid Orchid Display. It also contains a number of exceptional
                                    trees, including a Sacred Fig which is a clone descendant of the Bodhi tree that
                                    Buddha sat under for inspiration, a sapling of which was gifted to Mary Foster by <a

                                        Dharmapala</a> in 1913. All told, it contains 25 of about 100
                                    Oahu trees designated as exceptional.</p>

                                <p> The garden also contains several memorials and sculptures:</p>

                        <p>Foster Botanical Garden, measuring 13.5 acres (5.5 ha), is one of five public botanical gardens on Oahu. It is located at 50 North Vineyard Boulevard, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, near Chinatown at the intersection of Nu'uanu Avenue and Vineyard Boulevard. Foster is in a highly urban area with strip malls, schools, and Buddhist, Shinto, and Methodist religious facilities nearby.</p>

                        <p>The Garden is the oldest botanical garden in Hawaii, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

                    <h3>Origins</h3>
                    <p>In 1853, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalama">Queen Kalama</a> leased 4.6 acres (1.9 ha) of land to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hillebrand">William Hillebrand</a>, a German physician and botanist who built his home and planted trees on the site. During his stay, he introduced a number of plants to Hawaii, as well as deer and mynah birds. Many of the large trees growing today on the Upper Terrace were Hillebrand's plantings. After 20 years Hillebrand returned to Germany, where he published Flora of the Hawaiian Islands in 1888. In 1884 the property was sold to Thomas R. Foster and his wife Mary E. Foster (née Robinson), who continued to develop the garden as their homesite. Upon her death in 1930, Mary Foster bequeathed the land and her home to the City and County of Honolulu, with the provision that the city accept and forever keep and properly maintain the (gardens) as a public and tropical park to be known and called Foster Park. At the time, the gardens were roughly 5.5 acres (2.2 ha).[3]</p>

                    <p> Harold Lyon, the first director of Foster Garden, introduced thousands of new plants and trees to Hawaii, and started its famous orchid collection. Paul Weissich, director from 1957 to 1989, expanded Foster Garden to 14 acres (5.7 ha) of native plants, and developed four additional sites on Oahu Island to create the 650 acres (260 ha) Honolulu Botanical Gardens system. Taken as a whole, these five gardens feature rare species from tropical environments ranging from desert to rainforest, comprising the largest and most diverse tropical plant collection in the United States.[3]</p>
                        
                    <p> The Garden is the inspiration for a line in Joni Mitchell's 1970 folk song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Yellow_Taxi">"Big Yellow Taxi"</a>: "Took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum / Then charge people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.".[4]</p>

                    <h3>Foster Botanical Garden Today</h3>
                        
                    <p>Today the garden consists of the Upper Terrace (the oldest part of the garden); Middle Terraces (palms, aroids, heliconias, gingers); Economic Garden (herbs, spices, dyes, poisons); Prehistoric Glen (primitive plants planted in 1965); Lyon Orchid Garden; and Hybrid Orchid Display. It also contains a number of exceptional trees, including a Sacred Fig which is a clone descendant of the Bodhi tree that Buddha sat under for inspiration, a sapling of which was gifted to Mary Foster by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagarika_Dharmapala">Anagarika Dharmapala</a> in 1913.[citation needed] All told, it contains 25 of about 100 Oahu trees designated as exceptional.</p>
